# Pixel Table Virtualization & Optimization Plan

## Problem
Rendering a full 500x500 pixel table (250,000 cells) in React causes severe performance issues and browser crashes due to excessive DOM nodes.

## Solution Overview
1. **Virtualization**
   - Use a virtualization library (e.g., `react-window`) to render only visible rows/columns.
   - This reduces memory usage and improves responsiveness.
2. **Memoization**
   - Memoize pixel data calculations, but avoid generating all rows at once.
   - Only compute pixel data for visible cells.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Install Virtualization Library**
   - Add `react-window` to project dependencies.
2. **Refactor `PixelTable` Component**
   - Replace static table rendering with a virtualized grid.
   - Render only the cells currently visible in the viewport.
   - Use memoization for pixel data access per cell.
3. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Add a warning or confirmation before rendering large pixel tables.
   - Optionally allow users to select a smaller preview size.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Pixel table renders smoothly for large images (500x500 and above).
- No browser crashes or freezes.
- Pixel data is accurate and display modes (RGBA, HEX, Color) are preserved.
- User can scroll horizontally and vertically to view all pixels.
